# UAVs_optimal_path-_identification

The goal of this porject is to identify UAVs optimal path in Wireless IoT Sensor Networks.

Two optimization methods including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm and Simulated Annealing Optimization (SAO) 
Algorithm are modeled to compare the performance and execution time of these two methods in different size of sensors 
based on numerous parameters like number of sensors, distance of sensors, path identification duration. The results
obtained from performance evaluations of two optimization algorithm demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of 
proposed schemes.
